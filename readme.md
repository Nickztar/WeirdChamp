## Installation

* Setup a `.env` file

```.env
DISCORD_KEY={YOUR BOT KEY HERE}
CLIENT_ID={YOUR BOT ID HERE}
```

## Note

Some things are hardcoded for my ease and this was all made as some kind of joke. Just look through the code and replace what seems to be the issue. Will improve on it when I feel like it.
