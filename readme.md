## Installation

* Setup a `.env` file
* Add your bot token and bot ClientId as followed:
```.env
DISCORD_KEY={YOUR BOT KEY HERE}
CLIENT_ID={YOUR BOT ID HERE}
```

```bash
npm install
```
* (Optional) Add some `.mp3` files to [JoinSounds map](/JoinSounds) to play when a user joins the chat.

## Note

Some things are hardcoded for my ease and this was all made as some kind of joke. Just look through the code and replace what seems to be the issue. Will improve on it when I feel like it.
